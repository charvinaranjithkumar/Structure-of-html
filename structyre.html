    <!--Let's get to know about ways to maintain healthy eyes!!-->
    1) Eat right to protect your sight: <br> Keep your eyes healthy by eating a well-balanced diet. Load up on different types of fruits and veggies, especially leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens. Fish like salmon, tuna, and halibut have been shown to help your eyes, too. <br> 2) Wear your glasses: <br> Your glasses help you see better, especially when they’re clean and free of smudges. Talk to an adult about how to clean your glasses and how to store them when you’re not wearing them. <br> 3) Keep the germs away: <br> Always wash your hands before putting them close to your eyes, especially if you’re putting in or taking out contact lenses. <br> 4) Give your eyes a break: <br> Do you spend a lot of time looking at a computer, phone, or TV screen? Staring at any one thing for too long can tire your eyes. Give your eyes a rest with the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look about 20 feet away for 20 seconds.<br>
    <br>“The face is a picture of the mind with the eyes as its interpreter.” “Almost nothing need be said when you have eyes.” “I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my eyes and all is born again.”<br>Save your eyes!!
